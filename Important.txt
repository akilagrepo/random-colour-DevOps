jenkins - how will trigger - webhook - polling

jenkins read jenkins file - build,  test, build docker image (sh docker build -t) - push to docker hub (sh docker push akila/app:v1) - deploy k8s (sh kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml)

In project when dev push code - jenkins pipeline triggered automatically, it build the appln, create Docker image, push to docker hub
ans using kubectl command jenkin deploys the updated image to k8s cluster

Jenkin is ci and cd tool because it automatically build, test when developer push chnages. but it also supports cd by automating deployments to server like ec2 or k8s.

jenkin can run on single ec2
